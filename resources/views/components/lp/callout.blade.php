          <p>Progressive firms continue to make the transition from transaction-based accounting to higher value outsourced client accounting and advisory services. “Productization” of services, combined with cloud-based technologies have paved the way to standardizing client accounting services (CAS) that are scalable and profitable. Firms that have figured this out are serving as their clients’ “internal” accounting department and expanding their trusted advisor role.</p>

          <p>The guide spotlights four progressive firm leaders who have leveraged technology such as Bill.com and proven business practices to offer sophisticated client accounting and bill pay services.
